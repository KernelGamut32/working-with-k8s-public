# Lab 04 - Use Docker-Compose

* Exercise 1: https://github.com/CarlitosDroid/docker-compose-nodejs-mysql

    Test run of node app and db query. Update SQL script to add a new table and/or new records and rerun.
	If time permits, add a simple JSON display of the db records on the page.

* Exercise 2: https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose/tree/master/vuejs

    Get the base Vue.js container up and running. Using one of the other examples in the `awesome-compose` repo, expand to include a another type of container (your choice of type). Make sure the Vue.js container waits for the secondary container to spin up.

* Exercise 3: Build a multi-container deployment using at least 2 technology images of your choice. If you feel comfortable, integrate the containers in an interesting way (e.g., have a node API call to a mysql database and demonstrate via GET in browser or Postman, etc.).
