# Lab 12 - Prometheus

Use https://github.com/KernelGamut32/kiamol/tree/master/ch14. Forked from https://github.com/sixeyed/kiamol that accompanies a great book called "Learn Kubernetes in a Month of Lunches" by Elton Stoneman.

* Implement a basic deployment of Elasticsearch and Prometheus
* Integrate metrics gathering through Prometheus into the simple Elasticsearch instance
* Leverage a label in your Elasticsearch Pod spec to give Prometheus something app-specific to add to the captured metrics
