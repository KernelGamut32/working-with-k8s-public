# Lab 03 - Deploying WordPress and MySQL

Walk through the tutorial defined at https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/mysql-wordpress-persistent-volume/. Utilize either a local instance of k8s using Docker-Desktop with Kubernetes enabled (or another comparable option) or a remote instance to which you have permission to execute resource creation against.

**NOTE: If you already have `Docker Desktop` installed, you don't need to use `minikube` as called out in the tutorial - you can skip it and use `Docker Desktop` exclusively.**
